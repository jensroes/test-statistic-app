# Stats spin-off: exploring test statistics

This app is written for psychology UG students to practice and consolidate their understanding of core statistical tests.

In particular, the app illustrates how inference based on classical statistical tests (*t*-test, *ANOVA*, correlation, linear regression) translate to how the data are distributed. This can be seen by changing model parameters (including the dispersion of the data and the sample size).

The current version of the app can be found here: https://jens-roeser.shinyapps.io/test-statistic-app/
